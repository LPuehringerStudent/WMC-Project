# Project Title: *Minecraft Farmpedia*

## Project Overview
*Create an index for Minecraft Farms where you can search for a specific item you want to have farmed and in which Minecraft version it should work.
 There will be step by step guides with pictures provided by Laurenz (for example blueprints)*

## Objectives
- A website to help new people who want to build farms and it will also assist ourselves in building such farms!

## How did we get to this?

- It happens pretty often that you want to create a farm in servers, which is mostly complicated to create
so we had to search it up on YouTube which is really time consuming. So a simple solution would be an overview of farms all in one website.

## Features
The website will include the following features:

1. **Homepage**
   - A list of all farms. You can filter of desired items and versions.

2. **Navigation Menu**
   - Filtering and reset button of the filters and all Farms currently known



## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**

## Deliverables

## Submission Instructions

## Resources
