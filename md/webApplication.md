# CodeFlash - A Programming Vocabulary Trainer

## Overview
**CodeFlash** is a web application designed to help students learn and reinforce basic programming concepts using a vocabulary trainer approach. It presents key terms, definitions, and examples interactively to enhance learning through repetition and quizzes.

# ALL OF THESE ARE CURRENTLY JUST IDEAS!!!!!

## Features
### 1. Flashcard System
- Users see a programming term and try to recall its definition before flipping the card.
- Option to reverse the process: see a definition and guess the term.
- Example-based mode: show a code snippet and ask for the related concept.

### 2. Multiple Learning Modes
- **Definition to Term** – See a definition, guess the term.
- **Term to Definition** – See a term, recall the definition.
- **Example to Concept** – Identify the programming concept based on a code snippet.

### 3. Categorization
- Organize flashcards by:
    - **Grade Level** (e.g., Grade 9: Variables, Grade 10: Functions)
    - **Topic** (e.g., Loops, OOP, Data Structures)

### 4. Quiz Mode
- Multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank exercises to reinforce learning.
- Instant feedback on correct and incorrect answers.

### 5. Spaced Repetition System (SRS)
- Concepts that users struggle with appear more frequently.
- Well-known concepts appear less often, optimizing learning efficiency.

### 6. Progress Tracking
- Visualize progress through:
    - **Mastery Levels** (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Expert)
    - **Streaks and Achievements** to encourage consistent practice.

### 7. Custom Flashcard Creation
- Users can add their own terms and definitions for personalized learning.
- Option to share custom flashcard sets with classmates.

## Future Enhancements
- **Leaderboard & Challenges** – Gamify learning by allowing students to compete in programming vocabulary challenges.

## Conclusion
CodeFlash provides an interactive and engaging way to help students reinforce their programming knowledge in a structured and gamified manner. With flashcards, quizzes, and progress tracking, it ensures that learning programming concepts becomes both effective and fun.
